This research presents the design and evaluation of an intuitive dialogue management interface integrated with a Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) for non-technical medical experts. The interface facilitates the effective crafting of dialogues for eHealth conversational agents, focusing on the eCG Family Clinic project as a case study. The graphical user interface (GUI) and text editor components provide a seamless and synchronized interaction experience, enabling users to manage and edit dialogue content effortlessly. Prompt engineering techniques are employed to structure user requests using prompt templates, leveraging the capabilities of the PLM. Connectivity between the interface and the WOOL platform enables the conversion of dialogue diagrams into scripts suitable for conversational agents. The evaluation, based on feedback from medical experts, identifies areas for improvement such as scalability of the GUI, prompt management usability, and content quality generated by the PLM. Despite these challenges, the dialogue management interface demonstrates its potential as a valuable tool for non-technical medical experts, empowering them to design informative and inclusive eHealth conversational agents.
